The college app is designed to streamline the management of student in and out  by incorporating multiple user roles, including Admin and Warden. 

Here’s how it works:

Key Features:

1) User Roles:
Admin: The highest authority, responsible for making final decisions on defaulters.
Warden: A middle layer, responsible for monitoring and managing hostel-related issues and forwarding serious cases to the admin.

2) Defaulter Management:
Adding Defaulters: We can add a student to the defaulter list when they arrive late to the hostel after the intime. For each defaulter, it records:
* A live photo of the student
* The student’s registration number
* Hostel name
* Student’s name
* Date and time of the incident
The defaulter's information is stored in a database for further review.

3) Warden's Dashboard:
The Warden can view the list of defaulter students along with their details.
Actions for the Warden:
Forward to Admin: If the student’s case needs higher authority review, the Warden can forward the student’s details to the Admin.
Remove from Defaulter List: If the Warden feels the situation is resolved, they can remove the student’s name from the defaulter list.

4)Admin's Dashboard:
The Admin receives a list in the admin dashbaord when the Warden forwards a defaulter’s details.
The Admin can view the forwarded defaulters along with the associated details (photo, registration number, etc.).
Admin’s Actions:
Remove the student after the action: The Admin can mark the case as addressed, indicating no further action is required.
Take Action: The Admin can take appropriate disciplinary actions based on the severity of the situation.

Flow:
1) A student arrives late and the app registers their details, including a live photo, in the system.
2) 
3) The Warden either:
Resolves the issue and removes the student from the list, or
Forwards the student's details to the Admin for further action.
The Admin reviews the forwarded list and decides on disciplinary measures or closes the case.
